This repository contains the code I wrote to implement robust PCA 
following the paper "The augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method for Exact recovery of
Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices" by Lin, Chen and Ma (2014 version).

We use this code to write a given matrix C as the sum of a low rank matrix B and a 
sparse matrix A following "Rank-Sparsity Incoherence for Matrix Decomposition" by 
Chandrasekaran, Parillo et al...


It also contains a script solving this same problem but using a solver,
showing the time and overall perfomance comparition of 
both methods.

We use this code as well to do an implementation of graph clustering following "SHARP 
PERFORMANCE BOUNDS FOR GRAPH CLUSTERING VIA CONVEX OPTIMIZATION" by Vinayak et al.


We include as well an implementation of the theory of graph learning beeing developed in my 
master thesis.This Should appear soon.

This is a work in progress and therefore is subject to major changes...
