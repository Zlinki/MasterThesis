This repository contains the code i wrote to implement robust PCA 
following the paper "The augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method for Exact recovery of
Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices" by Lin, Chen and Ma (2014 version).

It also contains a script solving this same problem but using a solver.
Finally, it containts a notebook showing the time and overall perfomance comparition of 
both methods.

This is subject to major changes...
