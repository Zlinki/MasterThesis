This repository contains the code I wrote to implement robust PCA 
following the paper "The augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method for Exact recovery of
Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices" by Lin, Chen and Ma (2014 version).

It also contains a script solving this same problem but using a solver.
Finally, it containts a notebook showing the time and overall perfomance comparition of 
both methods.

An implementation of the theory of graph learning beeing developed in my 
master thesis should also appear soon.

This is subject to major changes...
